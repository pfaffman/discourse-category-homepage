# Set Home page to arbitrary URL

This theme component will allow an admin to specify the default homepage to any URL.

To set the home page for all users simply `home url override` in the theme settings.

To change the URL for just some users, create a group and enter the group name in `home url override group`. If that group is set then only members of that group will have their home page set to `home url override`. You could set a group that allows joining freely to allow users to select this alternate home page.
